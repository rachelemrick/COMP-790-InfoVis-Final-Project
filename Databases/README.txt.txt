our-aaa-publisher-list was made first by changing the stylization of publishers we already knew were aaa from aaa-aa-publisher-list.

We added Sony as a AAA publisher since their company makes billions of dollars each year.
We also added Nintendo as a AAA publisher since their company makes billions of dollars each year.
We also added Blizzard as a AAA publisher because all their games in the database were made after they became a big company. 


We also made our-indie-publisher-list to classify extra indie publishers that weren't in the original database.
We specifically wanted to classify a few major indie releases that were instrumental in the indie game revolution.

We added Mojang because their only listed game in the database is Minecraft, and that was indie when it came out (before being bought by Microsoft).
We added Toby Fox for Undertale
Team Cherry for Hollow Knight
Re-Logic for Terraria
Scott Cawthon for FNaF
