our-aaa-publisher-list was made first by changing the stylization of publishers we already knew were aaa from aaa-aa-publisher-list.

We added Sony as a AAA publisher since their company makes billions of dollars each year.
We added Nintendo as a AAA publisher since their company makes billions of dollars each year.
We added Blizzard as a AAA publisher because all their games in the database were made after they became a big company. 
We added Warner Bros. Interactive, Microsoft Game Studios, LucasArts, Altus, Valve Software, Hasbro Interactive as AAA because they are all supported by huge companies.
We added Atari as a AAA publisher because they were such industry trailblazers.


We also made our-indie-publisher-list to classify extra indie publishers that weren't in the original database.
We specifically wanted to classify a few major indie releases that were instrumental in the indie game revolution.

We added Mojang because their only listed game in the database is Minecraft, and that was indie when it came out (before being bought by Microsoft).
We added Toby Fox for Undertale
Team Cherry for Hollow Knight
Re-Logic for Terraria
Scott Cawthon for FNaF
Matt Makes Games Inc. for Celeste
Yacht Club Games for Shovel Knight
Supergiant Games for Hades
iam8bit for many games including Ori, Disco Elysium, and Stray
Studio MDHR for Cuphead
Psyonix Studios for Rocket League
3909 LLC for Papers, Please

We added Team 17, Team Meat, Campo Santo, Young Horses, Polytron, Robert Topala, 
Night School Studio, Facepalm Games, Red Hook Studios, Studio Pixel, 
Endnight Games Ltd, Starbreeze Studios, Jumpship, Pillow Castle, Nicalis,
Sloclap, Bedtime Digital Games, Thomas Happ Games, WayForward Technologies,
Amanita Design, as indie publishers because they are all self-proclaimed and pretty clear indie groups.
