# COMP 790: Information Visualization Final Project

## By Lili Enseling, Rachel Emrick, Raye Oji, Sokhna Fall

This Jupyter Notebook presents an interactive exploration of the dynamics between Indie and AAA game development over time. Utilizing Altair, a powerful visualization library, we delve into the trends, growth patterns, and disparities between these two sectors of the gaming industry.

The `Databases` folder stores all the data we compiled and used for our visualizations.
